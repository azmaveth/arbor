- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:
- **Elixir 1.15.7+** and **OTP 26.1+**
- **Git** configured with your name and email
- **GitHub account** for pull requests
- **asdf** (recommended) for version management

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arbor.git
   cd arbor
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/azmaveth/arbor.git
   ```
4. **Run initial setup**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```
5. **Verify everything works**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test.sh
   ```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development server
./scripts/dev.sh

# In another terminal, run tests frequently
./scripts/test.sh --fast

# Generate coverage reports
./scripts/test.sh --coverage

# Performance benchmarks (when optimizing)
./scripts/benchmark.sh
```

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow **Elixir community conventions** with some specific guidelines:

#### Formatting
- Use `mix format` for automatic code formatting
- Lines should not exceed 98 characters
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)

#### Naming Conventions
```elixir
# Modules: PascalCase
defmodule Arbor.Core.AgentSupervisor do

# Functions and variables: snake_case
def spawn_agent(agent_type, params) do

# Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
@default_timeout 5_000

# Private functions: snake_case with defp
defp validate_params(params) do
```

#### Documentation
- All public functions **MUST** have `@doc` annotations
- Use `@moduledoc` for module-level documentation
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Use `@spec` for function type specifications

```elixir
@doc """
Spawns a new agent with the given type and parameters.

## Parameters
- `agent_type`: The type of agent to spawn (atom)
- `params`: Configuration parameters (map)

## Returns
- `{:ok, agent_id}` on success
- `{:error, reason}` on failure

## Examples

    iex> Arbor.Core.spawn_agent(:task_executor, %{max_tasks: 5})
    {:ok, "agent_123"}
"""
@spec spawn_agent(atom(), map()) :: {:ok, String.t()} | {:error, term()}
def spawn_agent(agent_type, params) do
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Test Coverage
- **Minimum 80%** coverage across all applications
- **Property-based tests** for complex logic using StreamData
- **Integration tests** for component interactions
- **Performance tests** for critical paths

#### Test Organization
```elixir
defmodule Arbor.Core.AgentSupervisorTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true
  use ExUnitProperties
  
  doctest Arbor.Core.AgentSupervisor
  
  describe "spawn_agent/2" do
    test "spawns agent successfully with valid parameters" do
      # Test implementation
    end
    
    property "handles various parameter combinations" do
      # Property-based test
    end
  end
  
  describe "terminate_agent/1" do
    # More tests
  end
end
```

#### Testing Best Practices
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Follow the **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern
- Use `async: true` for tests that don't share state
- Mock external dependencies using `:meck` or `:hammox`
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Architecture Guidelines

#### Umbrella Applications
Arbor follows a **contracts-first architecture** with clear boundaries:

```text
arbor_contracts (no dependencies)
    ‚Üë
arbor_security ‚Üê arbor_persistence
    ‚Üë               ‚Üë
arbor_core ‚Üê--------‚îò
```

**Rules:**
- `arbor_contracts` has **zero dependencies** (foundational schemas/types)
- Dependencies flow **upward only** (no circular dependencies)
- Each app has a **single, clear responsibility**
- Inter-app communication via **well-defined contracts**

#### OTP Principles
- **Supervision trees** for fault tolerance
- **GenServer/GenStateMachine** for stateful processes
- **"Let it crash"** philosophy with proper error handling
- **Defensive programming** with comprehensive guards

#### Security First
- **Capability-based security** for all resource access
- **Input validation** at application boundaries
- **Audit logging** for security-relevant events
- **Principle of least privilege** throughout

### Git Workflow

#### Branch Naming
```bash
# Feature branches
feature/agent-hot-swapping
feature/distributed-tracing

# Bug fixes
bugfix/memory-leak-in-agent-pool
bugfix/capability-grant-race-condition

# Documentation
docs/contributing-guidelines
docs/architecture-overview

# Hotfixes
hotfix/security-vulnerability-cve-2024-001
```

#### Commit Messages
We use **Conventional Commits** format:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(core): add agent hot-swapping capability

Implements dynamic agent replacement without state loss.
Includes supervision tree updates and state migration.

Closes #123

fix(security): prevent capability privilege escalation

Ensures capability grants cannot exceed granter's permissions.
Adds validation in capability kernel with comprehensive tests.

BREAKING CHANGE: capability grant API now requires explicit permission validation

docs: update contributing guidelines with architecture section

perf(persistence): optimize event store batch operations
```
