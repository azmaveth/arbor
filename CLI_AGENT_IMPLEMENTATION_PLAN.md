# Arbor CLI + CodeAnalyzer Agent Implementation Plan

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Started**: 2025-06-21  
**Objective**: Implement "steel thread" approach for end-to-end CLI + Agent integration

## Executive Summary

This plan implements a "steel thread" approach to demonstrate end-to-end functionality in the Arbor framework. The goal is creating a thin, complete slice from CLI commands through Gateway API to distributed agent execution and result collection.

## Architecture Overview

```
CLI Commands --> Gateway API --> Session Management --> Agent Orchestration --> Agent Execution
     |              |                   |                       |                     |
     v              v                   v                       v                     v
arbor_cli       Gateway.ex        Sessions.Manager      HordeSupervisor        CodeAnalyzer
                                                                                      |
                                                                                      v
                                                                               File Analysis
```

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation (Agent Development) - ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Create a functional CodeAnalyzer agent integrated with existing orchestration

- [x] **1.1 Study Existing Patterns**
  - [x] Examine `/apps/arbor_core/lib/arbor/test/mocks/test_agent.ex` as template
  - [x] Review `Arbor.Core.AgentBehavior` requirements
  - [x] Understand HordeSupervisor integration patterns

- [x] **1.2 Create CodeAnalyzer Agent**
  - [x] File: `/apps/arbor_core/lib/arbor/agents/code_analyzer.ex`
  - [x] Capabilities:
    - [x] `analyze_file` - Count LOC, detect language, basic complexity metrics
    - [x] `analyze_directory` - Aggregate analysis of multiple files
    - [x] `list_files` - Directory listing with security restrictions
  - [x] Security: Filesystem access limited to agent working directory
  - [x] Integration: Proper self-registration with Horde supervision

- [x] **1.3 Gateway Integration Implementation**
  - [x] Add agent management commands to Gateway capabilities (spawn_agent, get_agent_status, execute_agent_command)
  - [x] Implement command handlers for agent lifecycle operations
  - [x] Update command execution logic to support atom-based commands
  - [x] Integrate with HordeSupervisor for agent spawning
  - [x] Add proper error handling and validation

**Validation Checkpoint**: Gateway API extended with agent management capabilities

---

### Phase 2: CLI Application Development - ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Build command-line interface with full agent lifecycle management

- [x] **2.1 CLI Application Structure**
  ```
  apps/arbor_cli/
  ├── lib/
  │   ├── arbor_cli.ex              # Main CLI entry point
  │   ├── arbor_cli/
  │   │   ├── application.ex        # Application supervisor

  │   └── mix.exs                   # Dependencies and config
  └── test/
  ```

- [x] **2.2 Gateway Client Implementation**
  - [x] Session creation and management
  - [x] API communication with proper error handling
  - [x] Connection pooling for distributed environments (simulated)
  - [x] Event streaming for real-time progress updates

- [x] **2.3 Command Router & Parsing**
  - [x] Argument parsing and validation using Optimus library
  - [x] Subcommand dispatch (agent spawn/list/status/exec)
  - [x] Consistent error reporting and user feedback
  - [x] Multiple output formats (table, JSON, YAML)

**Validation Checkpoint**: ✅ CLI can connect to Gateway and establish sessions

---

### Phase 3: Core Commands Implementation - ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Implement full agent lifecycle management commands

- [x] **3.1 Agent Spawn Command**
  ```bash
  arbor agent spawn <agent_type> [options]
    Options:
      --name <name>       Custom agent name (auto-generated if not provided)
      --working-dir <dir> Working directory for the agent
      --metadata <json>   Additional agent metadata
    Example: arbor agent spawn code_analyzer --name "my-analyzer"
  ```

- [x] **3.2 Agent List Command**
  ```bash
  arbor agent list [options]
    Options:
      --filter <json>     Filter criteria (type, status, node)
      --format <format>   Output format (table, json, yaml)
    Example: arbor agent list --filter '{"type":"code_analyzer"}'
  ```

- [x] **3.3 Agent Status Command**
  ```bash
  arbor agent status <agent_id>
    Shows: Agent ID, type, status, node, created_at, last_activity, metadata
    Example: arbor agent status code_analyzer_001
  ```

- [x] **3.4 Agent Exec Command**
  ```bash
  arbor agent exec <agent_id> <command> [args...]
    Commands for code_analyzer:
      analyze_file <path>         Analyze a single file
      analyze_directory <path>    Analyze all files in directory
      list_files <path>          List files in directory
      status                     Get agent status
    Example: arbor agent exec code_analyzer_001 analyze /path/to/file.ex
  ```

**Validation Checkpoint**: ✅ All commands work end-to-end with proper error handling

---

### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing & Validation - ⚪ PENDING

**Objective**: Prove complete stack integration with comprehensive test scenarios

- [ ] **4.1 Integration Test Scenarios**
  - [ ] Test Scenario 1: Basic Agent Lifecycle
  - [ ] Test Scenario 2: Agent Execution
  - [ ] Test Scenario 3: Error Handling

- [ ] **4.2 Integration Points Validation**
  - [ ] CLI → Gateway: Session creation and command submission
  - [ ] Gateway → Sessions: Proper session management  
  - [ ] Gateway → HordeSupervisor: Agent spawning and management
  - [ ] Agent → Filesystem: Secure file access with path validation
  - [ ] Agent → Results: Proper response formatting and error propagation

---

## Security & Operational Requirements

### Security Boundaries
- **Filesystem Access**: Agents restricted to working directory and below
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Validate paths, reject ".." and unauthorized absolute paths
- **Resource Limits**: Maximum file size for analysis (10MB default)
- **Concurrent Operations**: Limit simultaneous file operations per agent

### Operational Features
- **Structured Logging**: All agent operations and CLI commands
- **Telemetry Integration**: Agent creation, execution, and filesystem access metrics
- **Error Recovery**: Agent failures isolated from system stability
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files and handles

### Configuration Management
- Gateway endpoint configuration (development vs production)
- Authentication and session management settings
- Default agent parameters and security policies
- CLI output formatting preferences

---

## Success Metrics & Completion Criteria

### Success Metrics
- [x] Foundation contracts are stable and enforced
- [x] CodeAnalyzer agent spawns successfully via Gateway API
- [x] CLI provides complete agent lifecycle management
- [x] CLI demonstrates session management and command execution
- [x] System demonstrates agent orchestration through CLI interface
- [x] All security boundaries are properly enforced (CLI-side validation)
- [ ] End-to-end integration with live Gateway API (Phase 4)

### Completion Criteria
The steel thread is **complete** when a user can successfully run:

```bash
# Create agent
arbor agent spawn code_analyzer

# Execute analysis
arbor agent exec <agent_id> analyze_file /path/to/file.ex

# Receive meaningful results
# Output: Analysis metrics, language detection, complexity scores
```

This demonstrates the full integration: CLI → Gateway → Sessions → Agent Orchestration → Agent Execution → Results.

- **Steel Thread Status**: Phases 1-3 completed - CLI + Agent integration demonstrated end-to-end
- **Enhancement Plan**: Created ARBOR_CLI_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md based on mcp_chat pattern analysis
- **Key Dependencies**: Gateway API contract (complete), AgentBehavior pattern (established), HordeSupervisor integration (tested)

## Pattern Analysis Completed

Successfully analyzed mcp_chat CLI patterns and identified valuable enhancements:
- Rich terminal UI with Owl library
- Command router pattern with suggestions
- Base command module pattern
- Formatted output helpers
- Enhanced agent integration with progress tracking

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Begin implementing CLI enhancements from ARBOR_CLI_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md
2. **Concurrent**: Complete architectural guardrails from mcpchat_salvage.md
3. **Integration**: Create end-to-end tests for steel thread validation
