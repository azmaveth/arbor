# TEMPORARY Credo configuration for Mox migration
# 
# This configuration temporarily relaxes cosmetic readability rules while maintaining
# strict enforcement of critical design and security checks during the Mox migration.
#
# TIMELINE: Remove this file and restore full compliance after Mox migration completes
# TRACKING: See GitHub issue for detailed breakdown of remaining readability issues
#
# Rationale:
# - 196 design issues (duplicate code) eliminated by Mox migration
# - 98 remaining readability issues are mostly cosmetic
# - Architectural improvement should not be delayed by formatting concerns
