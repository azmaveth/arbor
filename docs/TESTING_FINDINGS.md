# Testing Findings Report

> Generated: June 28, 2024

This document summarizes the findings from testing the documented steps in Arbor's getting started guides.

## Executive Summary

The documentation describes features that are not yet fully functional due to application startup issues. While the code is structurally complete, there are runtime initialization problems preventing normal usage.

## Detailed Findings

### ‚úÖ Working Components

1. **Project Setup**
   - `./scripts/setup.sh` runs successfully
   - Dependencies install correctly
   - Database creation works (`mix ecto.create`)
   - Migrations run successfully (`mix ecto.migrate`)

2. **Test Suite**
   - Fast tests run successfully: 351 tests passing
   - Test infrastructure is well-organized
   - Multiple test tiers (fast, integration, distributed) are defined

3. **Documentation Structure**
   - Documentation is comprehensive and well-organized
   - Clear navigation and cross-references
   - Good coverage of architecture and design

### ‚ùå Non-Working Components

1. **Development Server Startup**
   - `./scripts/dev.sh` fails with application startup errors
   - Primary issue: `CapabilityStore` process registration conflict
   - Secondary issue: `Postgrex.TypeManager` registry not found
   - The application tries to start processes multiple times

2. **IEx Console Examples**
   - Cannot test session creation due to startup failures
   - Cannot test agent spawning functionality
   - Gateway commands cannot be executed

3. **Manual Test Scripts**
   - Module loading test fails - modules not available at runtime
   - Other manual tests cannot run due to application not starting

### üêõ Root Cause Analysis

The main issue appears to be with the application startup sequence:

1. **Process Registration Conflict**
   ```
   ** (EXIT) already started: #PID<0.288.0>
   ```
   The `CapabilityStore` is being started multiple times, causing conflicts.

2. **Registry Issues**
   ```
   ** (ArgumentError) unknown registry: Postgrex.TypeManager
   ```
   Database connection pool processes fail to find required registries.

3. **Environment Detection**
   - Works correctly in test mode (`MIX_ENV=test`)
   - Fails in development mode (`MIX_ENV=dev`)
   - Suggests configuration or initialization order issues

### üìã Documentation Accuracy

The documentation accurately describes the **intended** functionality but doesn't reflect the current non-working state:

- **GETTING_STARTED.md**: IEx examples cannot be tested
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md**: Should mention application startup issues
- **README.md**: Quick start steps fail after setup

### üîß Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Fix application startup sequence
   - Ensure processes are only started once
   - Verify registry initialization order

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Add troubleshooting section for startup issues
   - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with known startup problems
   - Add note about current alpha limitations

3. **Testing Improvements**
   - Add integration test for application startup
   - Verify dev environment initialization
   - Test manual scripts in CI

## Conclusion

While Arbor has a solid foundation with comprehensive documentation and a well-structured codebase, the application startup issues prevent users from following the getting started guides. The core functionality appears to be implemented but is inaccessible due to initialization problems.

The project is truly in alpha stage as indicated, with significant work needed to make it usable for early adopters.
